# To-Do

## Descripcion

This project is a simple "to-do" application. In this app, each user has their own profile, and within that profile they can create and manage their own tasks. Tasks are user independent, meaning they can be viewed and manipulated by any user registered in the system.

Each task has two possible states: "done" or "pending". When a task is created, by default it is in the "pending" state. Users have the ability to change the status of a task at any time, as well as edit both the task title and description.
